# Political-warfare
Describing and understanding the methods used in political warfare. What happens when conflict is used not to aqcuire a resource but to control groups of people.

## Concept
Politics is the field that is concerned with governing a group or groups. Political warfare, on the other hand, is all about governing groups in such a way as to increase the odds of winning a war. A war is a period in time where groups are involved in conflict. Conflict is a battle between opposing forces that always revolves around a difference in the timelines of the participating groups. This difference needs to overlap in both time and space in order to incite conflict, as this overlap forces both parties involved to confront these differences each and everytime they meet, be this interaction indirectly or directly. These differences therefore integrate into the timelines of both parties with each confrontation. This forces conformity with each added confrontation. Hence why each interaction between these groups is experienced as a form of repression. Conflict therefore is a quest to ensure the conformity of the opposing force without having to jeopardize your own timeline.

Political warfare therefore could be stated as the tool used to govern groups in such a way as to ensure the conformity of your timeline.

## Introduction
Political warfare has always been around, but has seen the height of its existence during the cold war. Back when the USSR and the USA were battling it out wheter communism was better or if capitalism was the better system. Both systems only govern how the economics of a society functions, how something receives its value. One derives the value of a product via supply and demand and the other has the state decide it for them, in order to ensure availibilty. Both have pros and cons, and in todays world most systems ended up implementing a combination between both systems. Having a free market as in capitalism yet also having some form of governmental control surrounding certain products to ensure availibility, i.e. social welfare/compensation where discounts and incomes are given to the poorer, public healthcare, government interventions in economic sectors that are at risk during an economic crisis, subsidies, etc.

Yet despite this being a difference in opinion in economic systems, one group ended up fearing the control the other group had and vice versa. And so both ended up trying to undermine the other, in an attempt to stop their 'influence'. This is where governing both your groups and the groups of others becomes vital, in other words politics became an essential tool to stop their influence and spread your own. And since these two economic systems were at a cross road with one another and constantly vying for control, tensions quickly escalated into conflict and later progressed into a war. Hence the birth of political warfare in order to fuel the cold war.

Also something worth noting, this war never was about the advantages of one system over the other it was about the amount of influence they had. And while this might seem like the same thing at first glance it is in fact not. The influence of anything is conveyed through the mood of the one exerting it, a metacognition therefore is always the vector for the influence. It's not about the thing itself it's about the thing surrounding the thing. Hence why this usually is a war conducted by and for sociopaths. They don't know what they're fighting the war for, they do however know that the other's influence will crumble when they win it. Hence why the cold war was a war of influence and of nothing else, it had no other substance behind it.

As insane as the cold war might have been and as fun as it would be to think that it is over, the shadow of that time period still looms over this world to this very day. Plenty of current conflicts were in fact incited by that time period. Those conflicts still need to be addressed as of now and the depressing thing about it all is that by the looks of things that way of reasoning surrounding influences has gone nowhere.

## Basics
The foundation for political warfare lies in division. When two groups are at war with one another, who both have achieved complete unity within their group, the amount of political warfare that can be conducted is rather limited. Political warfare at heart is about managing groups, both yours and the ones of the enemy. Yet when both are in absolute unity, there really isn't that much to manage in the first place. Unless you can manage the complete group, at which point the war will effectively have ended.

Which brings me to the go to tactic for anyone willing to conduct political warfare, divide and conquer. Division is the lifeblood of political warfare. To put it into a security perspective, each group that has fragmented off of the main timeline becomes a vector for any political warfare operations. These operations are better known as psychological operations or psyops. The only prerequisites for these operations is a fragmented timeline carried by a certain group and a willingness for that group to follow your lead. Considering the fact that they already moved away from the main timeline of the enemy usually makes 'recruiting' them under your managment or timeline a lot easier, but not guaranteed.

Since division is the key part of political warfare, it should come as no surprise to say that all tactics used in political warfare boil down to either encouraging the division in the enemy or strenghtening the unity in your own groups.

## Vectors
Groups end up being divided whenever their timelines start fragmenting off of one another. This fragmentation can either happen naturally due to disagreement or can be accelerated due to additional pressures.

Whenever timelines start fragmenting away from one another, they gradually start overlapping less and less. The same applies if the process is reversed, and two timelines start to unite with one another. These processes are continuous in nature, meaning that neither unity nor division happen overnight.

When timelines fragment off of another and decide to go their respective ways, they might still end up having an overlap even after a substantial amount of time has passed. Depending on the status quo that the group wishes to achieve timelines might be fully decoupled from another, with no overlaps at all. Or they might end up having an overlap with another, this overlap will then help facilitate interactions between these groups. Problem is, however, that sometimes a group really wants to isolate itself away from the other group. It simply does not want to have any interactions with it whatsoever, yet it is forced into it. Hence, conflict emerges to reduce this overlap. Conformity in these conflicts then becomes the end goal if no other way out of these overlaps is seen as achievable.

There are a number of ways to ensure this conformity in a timeline, however, the only reason for implementing any of these reasons is to combat a perceived sense of disunity. Because, that is the main reason to promote conformity, to not have any other groups overlap with the timeline of yours. The last thing you want is another group branching off from yours or another already existing group influencing your timeline. Ensuring conformity usually happens via one of the following ways :
* Censorship - "Deleterious" elements that could jeopardize your timeline are filtered out of existence or made inaccessible.
* Persecution - Groups with a deviating timeline from the perceived norm are systematically persecuted in order to dissuade any followers by introducing various difficulties in their lives.
* Propaganda - Other timelines are portrayed as inferior to your own.
* Repression - Limiting the mobility and freedom of all members of a group ensures less ways for them to defect or grow detached from your timeline by limiting the amount of experiences that they can come into contact with.

These methods usually are seen as a means to an end, they are employed because a certain timeline wants to ensure unity. These methods are not implemented to change your timeline, because after all that's what we're trying to avoid by ensuring conformity. Yet the funny part of all of this is that by implementing these methods of ensuring conformity, the ones that ended up implementing these very methods were the ones to change the timeline. Their ideals, their plans, their circumstances and their reputation wasn't built on these methods when they started using them hence why such tactics are never openly admitted. Because to do so, would be to break the very motive that ended up requesting these methods to ensure conformity. It would admit that the ones that defected from the main timeline were the ones whose very actions were to make sure that no one would ever defect from said timeline. It is hypocrisy, plain and simple. This hypocrisy is better known as a "police state", and is sadly found in a lot of countries in some way, shape or form. Some better developed than others, yet the hypocrisy still remains.

Ironically enough, it is this very betrayal of motive, this hypocrisy, that ends up inciting the very defection they were trying to avoid in the first place. This leads to a snowball effect, whereby the perceived defection is resolved through implementing more conformity inducing tactics which in turn sparks more defection. This cycle will keep on getting worse in of itself, hence why secrecy and violence is implemented to avoid it. Secrecy hides the hypocrisy and violence ensures that anyone that ends up finding out about it conforms to it either way.
