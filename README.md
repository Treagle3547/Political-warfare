# Political-warfare
Describing and understanding the methods used in political warfare. What happens when conflict is used not to aqcuire a resource but to control groups of people.

## Concept
Politics is the field that is concerned with governing a group or groups. Political warfare, on the other hand, is all about governing groups in such a way as to increase the odds of winning a war. A war is a period in time where groups are involved in conflict. Conflict is a battle between opposing forces that always revolves around a difference in the timelines of the participating groups. This difference needs to overlap in both time and space in order to incite conflict, as this overlap forces both parties involved to confront these differences each and everytime they meet, be this interaction indirectly or directly. These differences therefore integrate into the timelines of both parties with each confrontation. This forces conformity with each added confrontation. Hence why each interaction between these groups is experienced as a form of repression. Conflict therefore is a quest to ensure the conformity of the opposing force without having to jeopardize your own timeline.

Political warfare therefore could be stated as the tool used to govern groups in such a way as to ensure the conformity of your timeline.

## Introduction
Political warfare has always been around, but has seen the height of its existence during the cold war. Back when the USSR and the USA were battling it out wheter communism was better or if capitalism was the better system. Both systems only govern how the economics of a society functions, how something receives its value. One derives the value of a product via supply and demand and the other has the state decide it for them, in order to ensure availibilty. Both have pros and cons, and in todays world most systems ended up implementing a combination between both systems. Having a free market as in capitalism yet also having some form of governmental control surrounding certain products to ensure availibility, i.e. social welfare/compensation where discounts and incomes are given to the poorer, public healthcare, government interventions in economic sectors that are at risk during an economic crisis, subsidies, etc.

Yet despite this being a difference in opinion in economic systems, one group ended up fearing the control the other group had and vice versa. And so both ended up trying to undermine the other, in an attempt to stop their 'influence'. This is where governing both your groups and the groups of others becomes vital, in other words politics became an essential tool to stop their influence and spread your own. And since these two economic systems were at a cross road with one another and constantly vying for control, tensions quickly escalated into conflict and later progressed into a war. Hence the birth of political warfare in order to fuel the cold war.

Also something worth noting, this war never was about the advantages of one system over the other it was about the amount of influence they had. And while this might seem like the same thing at first glance it is in fact not. The influence of anything is conveyed through the mood of the one exerting it, a metacognition therefore is always the vector for the influence. It's not about the thing itself it's about the thing surrounding the thing. Hence why this usually is a war conducted by and for sociopaths. They don't know what they're fighting the war for, they do however know that the other's influence will crumble when they win it. Hence why the cold war was a war of influence and of nothing else, it had no other substance behind it.

As insane as the cold war might have been and as fun as it would be to think that it is over, the shadow of that time period still looms over this world to this very day. Plenty of current conflicts were in fact incited by that time period. Those conflicts still need to be addressed as of now and the depressing thing about it all is that by the looks of things that way of reasoning surrounding influences has gone nowhere.

## Basics
The foundation for political warfare lies in division. When two groups are at war with one another, who both have achieved complete unity within their group, the amount of political warfare that can be conducted is rather limited. Political warfare at heart is about managing groups, both yours and the ones of the enemy. Yet when both are in absolute unity, there really isn't that much to manage in the first place. Unless you can manage the complete group, at which point the war will effectively have ended.

Which brings me to the go to tactic for anyone willing to conduct political warfare, divide and conquer. Division is the lifeblood of political warfare. To put it into a security perspective, each group that has fragmented off of the main timeline becomes a vector for any political warfare operations. These operations are better known as psychological operations or psyops. The only prerequisites for these operations is a fragmented timeline carried by a certain group and a willingness for that group to follow your lead. Considering the fact that they already moved away from the main timeline of the enemy usually makes 'recruiting' them under your managment or timeline a lot easier, but not guaranteed.

Since division is the key part of political warfare, it should come as no surprise to say that all tactics used in political warfare boil down to either encouraging the division in the enemy or strenghtening the unity in your own groups.

## Vectors
Groups end up being divided whenever their timelines start fragmenting off of one another. This fragmentation can either happen naturally due to disagreement or can be accelerated due to additional pressures.
![Fragmentation](https://github.com/Treagle350/Political-warfare/blob/main/Images/Timeline%20fragmentation.gif)
Whenever timelines start fragmenting away from one another, they gradually start overlapping less and less. The same applies if the process is reversed, and two timelines start to unite with one another. These processes are continuous in nature, meaning that neither unity nor division happen overnight.

When timelines fragment off of another and decide to go their respective ways, they might still end up having an overlap even after a substantial amount of time has passed. Depending on the status quo that the group wishes to achieve timelines might be fully decoupled from another, with no overlaps at all. Or they might end up having an overlap with another, this overlap will then help facilitate interactions between these groups. Problem is, however, that sometimes a group really wants to isolate itself away from the other group. It simply does not want to have any interactions with it whatsoever, yet it is forced into it. Hence, conflict emerges to reduce this overlap. Conformity in these conflicts then becomes the end goal if no other way out of these overlaps is seen as achievable.

There are a number of ways to ensure this conformity in a timeline, however, the only reason for implementing any of these reasons is to combat a perceived sense of disunity. Because, that is the main reason to promote conformity, to not have any other groups overlap with the timeline of yours. The last thing you want is another group branching off from yours or another already existing group influencing your timeline. Ensuring conformity usually happens via one of the following ways :
* Censorship - "Deleterious" elements that could jeopardize your timeline are filtered out of existence or made inaccessible.
* Persecution - Groups with a deviating timeline from the perceived norm are systematically persecuted in order to dissuade any followers by introducing various difficulties in their lives.
* Propaganda - Other timelines are portrayed as inferior to your own.
* Repression - Limiting the mobility and freedom of all members of a group ensures less ways for them to defect or grow detached from your timeline by limiting the amount of experiences that they can come into contact with.

These methods usually are seen as a means to an end, they are employed because a certain timeline wants to ensure unity. These methods are not implemented to change your timeline, because after all that's what we're trying to avoid by ensuring conformity. Yet the funny part of all of this is that by implementing these methods of ensuring conformity, the ones that ended up implementing these very methods were the ones to change the timeline. Their ideals, their plans, their circumstances and their reputation wasn't built on these methods when they started using them hence why such tactics are never openly admitted. Because to do so, would be to break the very motive that ended up requesting these methods to ensure conformity. It would admit that the ones that defected from the main timeline were the ones whose very actions were to make sure that no one would ever defect from said timeline. It is hypocrisy, plain and simple. This hypocrisy is better known as a "police state", and is sadly found in a lot of countries in some way, shape or form. Some better developed than others, yet the hypocrisy still remains.

Ironically enough, it is this very betrayal of motive, this hypocrisy, that ends up inciting the very defection they were trying to avoid in the first place. This leads to a snowball effect, whereby the perceived defection is resolved through implementing more conformity inducing tactics which in turn sparks more defection. This cycle will keep on getting worse in of itself, hence why secrecy and violence is implemented to avoid it. Secrecy hides the hypocrisy and violence ensures that anyone that ends up finding out about it conforms to it either way.

## Fragmentation process
So given that the usual conformity inducing tactics are ineffective and that some groups will eventually branch off from the main timeline, there doesn't seem a whole lot we can do about it. It would seem, at a first glance, as if this form of decay or fragmentation is inevitable. However, in order to call this fragmentation inevitable or not, we would first have to look at how this timeline fragmentation takes place.

Usually, timeline fragmentation starts with some kind of disagreement or incompatibility. It's usually some kind of topic that is deemed by one or more parties involved to be sensitive. Something that invokes protest. At this stage, the timeline hasn't fragmented yet. However, the timeline itself is at a crossroad as a choice regarding the sensitive topic needs to be made. This very choice, inadvertently will cause the timeline to become fragmented. You chose one thing and it means losing group A, you chose the other and it means losing group B. Various governmental systems around the world try to combat these crossroads, autocractic regimes try to eliminate any branches from such decisions before they can gain any traction. Democracies try to live with these kinds of protests by putting the topic directly or indirectly to a vote, whereby the majority ends up deciding the outcome of the choice and the opposing party is expected to follow the choice of the majority. However, regardless of how such sensitive topics are dealt with it cannot be denied that these crossroads still fragment or damage a timeline. 

This initial stage of protesting against the conduct of a timeline is a stage in which the presence of an opposition is signified. This _**presence phase**_ therefore is meant to show that the protesters involved no longer wish to follow the lead of the main timeline anymore. This presence can only serve two purposes, first pressuring the main timeline with a risk of fragmentation and secondly establishing a new timeline. This stage is peaceful, it is only there to show discontent and have that discontent connect into a possible new timeline. Once this phase has passed the timeline will have begun fragmenting.

The next stage, involves civil forms of rebellion. This _**rebelling phase**_ therefore is used to pressure other parties into some form of compliance. At this stage, the presence of a timeline has already been established. With that presence, naturally as with any timeline, comes a goal. Since the discontent hasn't faded away, as the two timelines still haven't completely merged yet, one timeline will try to alter the main timeline into such a way as to minimize its own discontent. This usually involves increasing the pressure on a main timeline, examples of which can be found in civil disobedience such as skipping school or work. This pressure stems from a presence, more importantly it stems from a willingness to be noticed in such a way as to leave the main timeline no other choice other than to acknowledged the existence of the fragmented timeline.

The following stage, is usually marked by acts of sabotage. This _**sabotaging phase**_ is used to pressure the main timeline to the point that assets of the main timeline are destroyed, obstructed or vandalized in such a way as hold them hostage. With the threat of the sabotage only ending once the demands of the fragmented timeline are met. In other words, having the fragmented timeline continue its acts of sabotage until ransom in the form of their demands is paid.

The last stage is what happens when a fragmented timeline has achieved enough traction and momentum to take over institutions or resources on a permanent basis, at this point a civil war will emerge whereby a war will erupt in order to gain or maintain control over these institutions and resources. This makes the last stage of timeline fragmentation the _**civil war phase**_. At this stage, the fragmented timeline has abandoned any hope it once had for the main timeline to fulfill its demands and has instead started focusing on seizing the entire main timeline. Seizing its assets, followers and institutions in the process.

Something to note, these stages depending upon the conflict can occur in any time domain whatsoever. They are not exclusive to the present such as in the case of violent protests. They can also occur in the future, whereby plans are jeopardized. They can happen in the distant future, whereby assets of the main timeline are associated with morally repulsive elements. They can happen in the past, whereby reputations are tarnished or altered.

## Security
### Intro
Security usually refers to the ability of safeguarding yourself and others to various dangers. Security can come in all sorts of arrangments, however to start off I figure I might as well use a physical example in order to draw an analogy. Considering bullet proof vests to be a form of security against bullets, whereby the energy from the bullet is drawn away from it in such a way as not to endanger the wearer of the bullet proof vest. Because, after all that is the main purpose of bullet proof vests, stopping the bullet before it can pass through you. 

The same applies to another physical example of security, consider any form of access control such as a guard verifying someone's identity at a gate, a finger print scanner or some form of advanced locking mechanism. All that these things really end up doing, from the perspective of a determined attacker, is slow the attacker down. If those acces control mechanisms had not been in place, it would have only made the threshold for an attack lower. The easier a target is to attack the more time and energy can be invested in the actual thing you're interested in. As interesting as doors may be, I doubt anyone would attack one with a motive other than to get inside. Therefore, I would say that all these security mechanisms really end up doing is drawing energy away from the actual target. In this case, the door absorbs the energy that the items behind it normally would if it had not been there, in the same way the bullet proof vest did in our first example. This absorbtion of energy therefore is essential to the concept of security as a whole.

These energy absorbing elements are vital security instruments that slow attackers down to the point that their energy over time gets depleted, hence why such measures could be considered anticatalysts. Anticatalysts slow down reactions to heavily reduce a reaction or even prevent it all together.

### Anticatalystic systems
In order to slow down an attack or even drain it of its energy or intensity, an intake or sink for this energy has to be realised. 
Remember that an emotional axis has two polarities, the exhibisionistic polarity and the voyeuristic polarity.
Exhibisionistic polarities establish a presence, they facilitate or bring actions outward, they produce effects. 
Voyeuristic polarities facilitate the intake of information, they bring actions or events inward, they produce causes.

Coupling cause and effect with one another forms a complete picture of an action. Note that there are two modes of conciousness, the concious and the metaconcious.
From start to end they go as follows, 

(sub)concious cause -> concious effect -> metaconcious effect -> meta(sub)concious cause -> (sub)concious cause -> ...

This means that if we move energy from one domain to the next, we can redirect that energy into a sink or voyeuristic polarity.
Redirecting this energy in such a way drains the energy with each stage depending upon the reasonance of the energy trapped in the stage prior.
If you can make an argument that resonates with a person, you can tap into the energy that was previously trapped in a concious stage prior to the one you are now seeing. 
Most probably, this stage will be a voyeuristic one after the argument has been made.
